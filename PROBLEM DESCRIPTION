 Please create a simple secure temporary file sharing service. The service should meet the following requirements:

    Provide an API to upload files/folders. The API will return an HTTP link that can be used to retrieve the file/folder contents.
    The files will be stored encrypted.
    HTTP links will expire after a day and stop working.
    Create a web front-end interface to upload files/folders.

Please use any programming language, framework or (free) library you deem fit. It shouldn't take too much of your time – we place a lot of weight on sticking to a simple first implementation, accompanied by concrete suggestions on best ways to extend and move forward.

We'll be paying close attention to your README with running instructions, TODOs, thoughts, and potential enhancements — so that's a real opportunity to shine.

Bonus: deploy the application on Heroku, and send us a link to try it. 

Please explicitly address:

    Scalability: what are some of the considerations when you need to create and serve many links in parallel? What if people upload very big files?
    Resiliency: how will you handle errors in various components of your system? How will you recover gracefully?
    How would you support password-protection in addition to the encryption?
